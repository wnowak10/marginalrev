This project crawls MR.com and finds word count and other key data for MR posts.

I was lucky enough to actually get a shout out from Tyler Cowen himself about this work! See: http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2016/09/toward-theory-marginal-revolution-blog.html#comments

Workflow:
0. use working.py to create day object with class functions. urllib2 is used to load pages and beautifulsoup is used create 'soup'.

1. loop through days and instantiate day object for each day. call function for each post of the day. export to csv.
>> major lessons: objects help simplify. fully understanding BS library is great help to scraping efficiently. placing try and except statements helps code from crashing.

2. use R to clean and then export a clean CSV file. regex gsub function often used to delete extraneous characters

3. do analysis. 
>> major lessons: dealing with date times is a pain. lubridate library seems promising but doesnâ€™t seem to work with Kaggle.
