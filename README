workflow:
0. use working.py to create day object with class functions
1. loop through days and instantiate day object for each day. call function for each post of the day. export to csv.
>> major lessons: objects help simplify. fully understanding BS library is great help to scraping efficiently. placing try and except statements helps code from crashing.
2. use R to clean and then export a clean CSV file
3. do analysis. 
>> major lessons: dealing with date times is a pain. lubridate library seems promising but doesnâ€™t seem to work with Kaggle.
